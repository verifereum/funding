# Project Description
- What is the project about and what kind of impact does it aim to have?

TL;DR

Verifereum is a formal model of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in higher-order logic (HOL). The aim of the project is to enable verification of applications that run on Ethereum and other EVM chains, covering smart contracts and decentralised protocols, compilers to/from EVM bytecode, and infrastructure for proof engineering and developing formal specifications. Verifereum is developed using HOL4  (https://hol-theorem-prover.org).

Verifereum is a formal model of Ethereum implemented in higher-order logic (HOL4). The project aims to enable the verification of applications and tools within the Ethereum ecosystem, from smart contracts to compilers. Verifereum would not target any specific set of smart contracts or programming languages but is meant to be a general framework for formal verification in the Ethereum space.

Use of funds

Funds donated to Verifereum will be used to pay for research and development costs, including supporting existing contributors and paying for or hiring bounty hunters, contractors, and/or team members. Additional funding may be used towards developer community growth events such as mentorship programmes and workshops.

Verifereum is fully free and open source, encouraging contributions from ecosystem participants at all levels of expertise and committment. The project aims to become the reference framework for formal verification work for all Ethereum applications and to build a large community of contributors. It will contribute to securing the EVM (by providing another formal model of its mechanics), its programming languages such as Solidity and Vyper, and potentially any set of smart contracts.

While Verifereum may serve as the basis for for-profit ventures in the future (for instance, auditing or consulting), the formal specifications, research, proofs, and documentation will always remain free and open source.

Team members

Ramana Kumar - Ramana has a PhD in computer science and has done extensive academic research on formal verification (https:// scholar.google.com/citations?user=OyX1-qYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra). They are a world leading expert on compiler verification and a key contributor to CakeML, a verified implementation of ML and one of a handful of formally verified compilers. An active contributor to the liquid staking derivative ecosystem on Ethereum, Ramana combines their expertise in formal verification with a deep knowledge of the EVM. https://github.com/xrchz/

James Sanderson - James brings extensive strategy and operations experience across corporate environments, early-stage projects, and startups. As co-founder of London Business School's inaugural Blockchain Society, he advocates for the safe transition from Web2 to Web3 by building essential infrastructure to enable this evolution.

NOTE: We also accept and encourage contributions from the open-source community supporting Verifereum, including (at time of writing) six additional GitHub contributors.

Impact

The blockchain audit industry, currently worth $3bn* is expected to grow tenfold over the next 5 years (https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/blockchain- security.asp), signaling the tremendous demand for rigorous scrutiny of on-chain apps. By mathematically proving that a contract behaves exactly as expected relative to a clearly defined specification, formal verification offers the highest assurance of vulnerability-free code.

Verifereum intends to have impact on these problems:
• Smart contract security: Verifereum will enable developers to mathematically prove that their smart contracts are exempt from all exploits of a certain type. This will, in turn, enhance the overall trust in Ethereum as a platform.
• Compiler reliability: The Ethereum ecosystem, with its reliance on a couple of languages with no verified compilers, is particularly vulnerable to compiler bugs. By focusing on compiler verification, starting with Vyper, Verifereum will increase confidence in the correctness of compiled smart contract code.
• Advancement of formal methods: Verifereum will push forward the state-of- the-art in formal verification on Ethereum and provide a more expressive and trustworthy framework for developers to work with.
• Community building and education: Drawing upon the experience and network acquired while building the CakeML community, Verifereum will help grow the pool of developers skilled in formal verification methods. We plan to do so by onboarding technical and non-technical contributors, providing documentation and tutorials, and organising outreach events.

*$8bn+ has been lost in various smart contact hacks since the launch of Ethereum.
