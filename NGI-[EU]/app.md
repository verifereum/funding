This form can be used to request support for your project. Note that releasing software, hardware and content under libre/open licenses, and the application of open standards where possible are transversal requirements for all. From our end we will provide a transparent and efficient selection process. Please check the (call-specific) guide for applicants for the call you are interested in.

Please also don't forget to look into our privacy statement about how we deal with your information (should be a pleasant surprise, actually — we really care about your privacy. Throughout the years we've funded the development of quite some widespread privacy enhancing technologies ourselves).

A practical point: we recommend to prepare longer answers offline, in case something goes wrong with your browser session. It is a light weight procedure, please don't wait until the last hour before the deadline before submitting — deadlines are hard.

# Please select a call
In the list of current calls below, please indicate the call topic you are responding to. Note that some larger funds (like the NGI0 Commons Fund) and smaller funds with targeted calls (like NGI Fediversity, TALER and Mobifree — all part of the Next Generation Internet initiative) will have some special scope or conditions. You'd better have a look at the respective guides for applicants before you submit a proposal. If in doubt, submit to our open call and mention in the application that you are okay with us allocating your proposal to the most suitable fund.

Please be short and to the point in your answers; focus primarily on the what and how, not so much on the why. Add longer descriptions as attachments (see below). If English isn't your first language, don't worry — our reviewers don't care about spelling errors, only about great ideas. We apologise for the inconvenience of having to submit in English. On the up side, you can be as technical as you need to be (but you don't have to). Do stay concrete. Use plain text in your reply only, if you need any HTML to make your point please include this as attachment.

# Abstract: Can you explain the whole project and its expected outcome(s):
    
Verifereum is a formal model of the EVM in higher-order logic  intended to support a broad range of formal verification uses, primarily as the basis for proving comprehensive theorems about Ethereum applications (i.e., decentralised applications / smart contracts) ensuring that they are implemented correctly and have desirable / intended properties such as not being exploitable by malicious on-chain interactions. Verifereum will help safeguard the future of the internet.

The Verifereum project aims to maintain an up-to-date EVM semantics that accurately models on-chain execution for all applications live on mainnet (and other EVM chains), and hence to remain relevant as Ethereum hardforks are deployed.

The blockchain audit industry, currently worth $3bn* is expected to grow tenfold over the next 5 years (https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/blockchain- security.asp), signaling the tremendous demand for rigorous scrutiny of on-chain apps. By mathematically proving that a contract behaves exactly as expected relative to a clearly defined specification, formal verification offers the highest assurance of vulnerability-free code.

Verifereum's expected outcomes include but are not limited to:
• Smart contract security: Verifereum will enable developers to mathematically prove that their smart contracts are exempt from all exploits of a certain type. This will, in turn, enhance the overall trust in Ethereum as a platform.
• Compiler reliability: The Ethereum ecosystem, with its reliance on a couple of languages with no verified compilers, is particularly vulnerable to compiler bugs. By focusing on compiler verification, starting with Vyper, Verifereum will increase confidence in the correctness of compiled smart contract code.
• Advancement of formal methods: Verifereum will push forward the state-of- the-art in formal verification on Ethereum and provide a more expressive and trustworthy framework for developers to work with.
• Community building and education: Drawing upon the experience and network acquired while building the CakeML community, Verifereum will help grow the pool of developers skilled in formal verification methods. We plan to do so by onboarding technical and non-technical contributors, providing documentation and tutorials, and organising outreach events.

*$8bn+ has been lost in various smart contact hacks since the launch of Ethereum.
