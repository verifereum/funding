# Project Abstract

The proposed project is: Update the formal semantics of the EVM defined in
Verifereum for the Pectra upgrade.

Verifereum is a formal model of the EVM in higher-order logic intended to
support a broad range of formal verification uses, primarily as the basis for
proving comprehensive theorems about Ethereum applications (i.e. decentralised
applications / smart contracts) ensuring that they are implemented correctly
and have desirable/intended properties such as not being exploitable by
malicious on-chain interactions.

The Verifereum project aims to maintain an up-to-date EVM semantics that
accurately models on-chain execution for all applications live on mainnet (and
other EVM chains), and hence to remain relevant as Ethereum hardforks are
deployed.

# Project Team

## Team members:

Ramana Kumar is the lead contributor for the Verifereum project, and will take the lead on this upgrade project too.

We will also accept and encourage contributions from the open-source community supporting Verifereum, including (at time of writing) [six additional GitHub contributors](https://github.com/verifereum/verifereum/graphs/contributors).

## Background

Ramana has a PhD in computer science and has done extensive academic research on formal verification (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OyX1-qYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra). He is a world leading expert on compiler verification and a key contributor to CakeML, a verified implementation of ML and one of a handful of formally verified compilers. An active contributor to the liquid staking derivative ecosystem on Ethereum, Ramana combines his expertise in formal verification with a deep knowledge of the EVM. His background makes him uniquely qualified to build the Verifereum EVM formal verification framework, and Verifereum-based projects for application verification (including via verified compilation).

The project is entirely free and open source, hosted on [GitHub here](https://github.com/verifereum/verifereum).

# Relevant Pectra EIPs

Since the EVM semantics is primarily concerned with the Execution Layer (EL) of
Ethereum, all the Pectra EIPs that touch the EL are relevant. This is _all_ the
Pectra EIPs except for EIP-7549 (Move committee index outside Attestation)
which only touches the Consensus Layer.

# Objectives

List the project goals:

- Goal 1: Update the formal EVM semantics for each of the 10 relevant Pectra EIPs
- Goal 2: Ensure the updated semantics passes the EL test suites (as updated for Pectra)
