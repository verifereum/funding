# Project Abstract

The proposed project is: Update the formal semantics of the EVM defined in
Verifereum for the Pectra upgrade.

Verifereum is a formal model of the EVM in higher-order logic intended to
support a broad range of formal verification uses, primarily as the basis for
proving comprehensive theorems about Ethereum applications (i.e. decentralised
applications / smart contracts) ensuring that they are implemented correctly
and have desirable/intended properties such as not being exploitable by
malicious on-chain interactions.

The Verifereum project aims to maintain an up-to-date EVM semantics that
accurately models on-chain execution for all applications live on mainnet (and
other EVM chains), and hence to remain relevant as Ethereum hardforks are
deployed.

# Relevant Pectra EIPs

Since the EVM semantics is primarily concerned with the Execution Layer (EL) of
Ethereum, all the Pectra EIPs that touch the EL are relevant. This is _all_ the
Pectra EIPs except for EIP-7549 (Move committee index outside Attestation)
which only touches the Consensus Layer.

# Objectives

List the project goals:

- Goal 1: Update the formal EVM semantics for each of the 10 relevant Pectra EIPs
- Goal 2: Ensure the updated semantics passes the EL test suites (as updated for Pectra)
